#summary This is my wiki page about me, a brief description of mine.
= Who am I ? =

* My name is Muhammed Sabri Şahin. This is my 7th semester in Boğaziçi University. I'm _used to_ be interested in coding, but now I'm not. I love listening to music of new genres. I also like to play _classical_ guitar.
