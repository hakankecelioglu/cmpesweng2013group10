= Who am I ? =

My name is Muhammed Sabri Şahin. This is my 7th semester in Boğaziçi University, Computer Engineering.

== Details ==
 * I _used to_ be interested in coding, but now I'm not. I hope I'll have my enthusiasm for coding soon.
 * I love listening to music of new genres. _Classical music_ is however my favorite one. I'm also into _jazz_, _lounge_ and _chillout_ lately.
 * I play _classical guitar music_ (not Akdeniz Akşamları!) with my _classical guitar_, a lot.
