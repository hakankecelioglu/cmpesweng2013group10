#brief introduction of me.

= Introduction =

Hello everyone. My name is Dilara Kekulluoglu, it is my third year at Bogazici University, Computer Engineering.


= Details =
I had no idea about what computer engineers did when I entered this university. Although it is hard to fulfill the expectations, I am somewhat contented with my major.

I have interest in asian languages. 
 * It is my third year studying Japanese, I have upper intermediate Japanese 
 * I am also learning Korean by myself.
 * I don't have any more courage to tackle Chinese.
 * I would also love to learn Thai, though it seems impossible at this point.
