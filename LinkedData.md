# What is Linked Data? #

Linked Data is a method of publishing. The data going to be published are structured and related data are interlinked, so that searching becomes more useful and disambiguity disappears.

# Introduction #

Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, asked the users to put their information as documents and users did not do this of course. So he proposed us to keep the information on web pages as raw data, because raw data can be linked to another raw data. It creates a connection between users and their information which makes whole information as one single interlinked data space.

# Details #

There are 4 steps to establish Linked Data:

  1. Data on the web should be open to anyone so that it can be manipulated and reached by others.
  1. The links between the data should be established in a proper and absolute way which is called Resource Description Framework. All the RDF of all information are interconnected.
  1. As each web site has its own unique address, data should have too. This is done by Uniform Resource Identifier. Using protocols, a specific resource represents itself in a specific way. It simply is a string of characters.
  1. Data should be online in a certain protocol, named HTTP.

# Why is it good to use? #

For instance you'd like to search for the word "king". You are looking for B.B King. The search engine you're using, or Google, comes up with many irrelevant results. There are King, the name of a brand, or the king, the name of a piece in chess or Lebron James the King. Linked Data understands that you mean the blues guitarist BB King and directs you to the appropriate web page. Since relevant web pages are connected to the current web page you are currently investigating, their web statistics rises and Linked Data acts like a optimization for search engines.
