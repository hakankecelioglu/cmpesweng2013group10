# Introduction #

Hi, I'm Serdar Kuzucu. I'm working in a software company named Inomera. We are now working on a cloud backend service, Netmera. I'm working on its back-end, front-end, and Javascript SDK.

The most known thing about me is that I like sleeping more than anyone likes. I can sleep everywhere as you can see in the classroom. Apart from that, I've no time to do anything, except writing code.

I've a blog, here's the link: http://blog.asosyalbebe.com/
