<h1>Personal Info</h1>
I'm Berhan Şenyazar, a senior Computer Engineering student at Boğaziçi University.<br>
<br>
My hometown is Kastamonu but I also see Karabük, the city I spent my high school years, as my secondary hometown.<br>
<br>
Everything with a story is an interest area for me but especially two end points of the spectrum, literature and interactive storytelling media are my main interests.<br>
<br>
I may work in video game industry or digital media development but I may also keep them as hobbies and work in more "serious" areas like embedded systems or machine learning applications.<br>
